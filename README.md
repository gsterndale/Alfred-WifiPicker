# Alfred-WifiPicker

A WiFi scanner, selector, and connector workflow for Alfred. This is a simple workflow to allow 
you to quickly pick a WiFi network to connect to. Lots of people have asked for this amidst the 
dozens of wifi togglers but surprisingly this is the first one to be written.

Based on:
